# pulling all draft data ----
# problem: get data for ALL drafts available in the API
# problem: API doesn't tell us how far data goes, find a way to go all the way to the last 
# possible year without having to manually insert the year. It has to be done progammatically.

# 1st action, go year by year until it satisfies some condition that will stop the process
  # 1st hurdle: what is the most recent year?

  # what is the condition then? Look at an year that you know there is no draft
  # and see how the api responds (throws and error, returns an empty data etc)
